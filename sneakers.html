This singular edition of the Dunk Low uses the latter of those two icons as its primary inspiration, with fuzzy faux fur and smooth suede overlays covering the majority of the shoeâ€™s upper. An abstract swoosh mimics the collars worn by each illustrated ursine, featuring a frayed outline unlike any previous version of the silhouette. A plethora of details shaped by the band further elevate the look, including aglets adorned with lightning bolts, restyled font on the heel and bold text graphics inside both tongues. A hidden insignia on the sockliner combines with complementary alternate laces and a cleverly obscured zipper pocket to close the curtain on this mind-bending tribute.", "position": "bottom"}]
