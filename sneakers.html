This singular edition of the Dunk Low uses the latter of those two icons as its primary inspiration, with fuzzy faux fur and smooth suede overlays covering the majority of the shoe’s upper. An abstract swoosh mimics the collars worn by each illustrated ursine, featuring a frayed outline unlike any previous version of the silhouette. A plethora of details shaped by the band further elevate the look, including aglets adorned with lightning bolts, restyled font on the heel and bold text graphics inside both tongues. A hidden insignia on the sockliner combines with complementary alternate laces and a cleverly obscured zipper pocket to close the curtain on this mind-bending tribute.", "position": "bottom"}, {"title": "AIR VAPORMAX 2020 FLYKNIT 'PURE PLATINUM'", "imageURL": "https://static.nike.com/a/images/t_prod_ls/w_1920,c_limit,f_auto/e2c865b6-199d-474e-894f-bb6bd1c708fa/air-vapormax-2020-flyknit-pure-platinum-release-date.jpg", "retailPrice": "$220", "priceSpan": "$490 - $550", "releaseDate": "07/23/2020", "imgArray": ["https://static.nike.com/a/images/w_1920,c_limit,f_auto/851313a3-0c59-484a-bd48-1d5d6324cfef/air-vapormax-2020-flyknit-pure-platinum-release-date.jpg", "https://static.nike.com/a/images/w_1920,c_limit,f_auto/db77030b-7521-47a5-8856-5f9d3e2a1a20/air-vapormax-2020-flyknit-pure-platinum-release-date.jpg"], "brand": "Nike", "description": "The Nike Air VaporMax 2020 Flyknit offers more than innovative wearability.

The goal was to build a piece of footwear that can thrive in urban environments. All of these performance innovations live in harmony, providing comfort, protection, and durability. The Road Warrior references the pioneering design of the 2-hour marathon breaking Nike Air Zoom Alphafly Next% and the energy return of the Nike Air Zoom BB NXT. The open floating heel borrows from early Nike Shox prototypes, but shifts from the boing boing effect of the pillars to incorporate double stack zoom pods and double under foot plates. We didn’t want to sacrifice stability. That’s why the Road Warrior re-imagines a traditional Japanese split-toe cage (commonly used in construction and road work boots) for a back-to-basics barefoot stance.", "position": "top"}]
